# Introduction
We use our hands to play most musical instruments. Why not make a hand-instrument? A combination of sensors mounted on a glove is used to generate sounds on a personal computer. The glove has 5 flex sensors (one along each finger), 5 pressure sensors (one on each finger tip), and an inertial measurement unit (MPU-6050) consisting of a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. The sensors send analog data via a micro-controller (e.g. Arduino) to the serial port on a computer. The data then gets processed in real-time to create music. For a start, Python and Arduino are used to make it accessible to everyone and encourage developers to contribute. The basic functionality also requires a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) like GarageBand, Logic or Ableton.


#Setup

## Packages
This package uses Python 3.5. The following packages are required 
- [mido](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mido/1.1.3) is used to send midi messages to a virtual instrument. Install with `pip install mido`.
- [rtmidi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi/0.3.1a) is used as a backend for mido. Install with `pip install python-rtmidi`.
- [PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/) is used for an optional GUI. Install with `pip install pyqt5` and by following instructions [here](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html).

## Virtual instrument
MIDI messages are sent from the python code to a DAW (e.g. GarageBand) on the computer. For this you need to setup a virtual midi port. For mac, use the following [instructions](http://feelyoursound.com/setup-midi-os-x/). Then, replace the `IACDriver` variable `__init__.py` with your virtual midi port name. Once this is done, the DAW will discover the app as a midi instrument.

# Usage
For compiling a non-GUI version, run `python Main.py`. In `Main.py`:
- For `PressureNotes = 1`, the glove triggers a set of notes with the pressure sensors specified by `n1`, with threshold pressure `pressThresh`
- For `FlexNotes = 1`, the glove triggers a set of notes with the flex sensors specified by `n2`, with threshold flex `pressThresh`
- For `FlexPitchChords = 1` uses the IMU pitch data to trigger a chord when below a certain angle, and the flex sensors to specify the chord. The mapping is specified in the `trig2chord` function in `notemidi.py`.
- For a table of all possible notes, see the csv file `data/tables/note2midi.csv`.
- Pressure and Flex sensors can be used in combination as they run in two seperate threads but this is not recommended. For now, only have one of the above set to 1.

- Simulation: if you don't have a glove, it is most convenient to use the simulation functionality. For `sim = 1` and a specified simulation file `simfile`, the program will read sensor data recorded from the glove in the `data/sim/` folder. Otherwise, if you are using the glove, set it to 0.
- Recording: if you have the glove and want to record a file for future simulation, run `python sensor_read.py`. Your sensor data will be recorded in the `filename` you specify in the script.

## GUI
For a more intuitive usage of the glove, there is a GUI application using PyQt5 (not yet complete). This can be used by running `python gluvUI.py`.


## Potential Applications
- String instrument (e.g. violin) with pressure sensors for notes and accelerometer for vibrato
- pressure sensors with accelerometer data triggering percussion instruments by shaking the hand (audio using PyAudio)
- Accelerometer conductor baton for controlling playback speed in realtime (requires addition of playback capabilities)
- General language (gesture sequences) for triggering specific musical events
- Incorporating VMO for improvising with the gluvn!
