TODO:
	- Calibrate flex sensors (Arduino)
	- Analyze plots
	- Get acceleration from arduino

	* Applications:
		- Simple melody 	
		- Bow melody
		- Vibrato
		- Chords in arpeggiators
		- Loops

	- Autocalibrate flexes 
		- Open hand: press when ready
		- Press when done
		- Close hand: press when ready
		- Press when done
		- Calibration saved in data/settings/
		- Get transforms in runs

CODE:
	- Fix 
	- PortL and portR, as well as everything in __init__.py should be change to caps (constants)
	- put class Stats in different file (than data_analysis.py)
	- Fix data_analysis indentation
	- Put all plotting capabilities in a Visualize: class
	- All functions need to be generalized to include 2 hands	
		- Fix Analyze, readData etc..
	
DOCUMENTATION:
	- Use sphynx

CALIBRATION:
	Flex Sensors Calibration:
		396	514	440	418	451
		658	806	697	676	783

BUY:
	- Big shrink tube for neck of pressure sensor 

ISSUES:
- 67K is probably too high (for old glove) - 47K might be ideal - or 10K as recommended.
- FSR in index finger of left glove doesn't work
